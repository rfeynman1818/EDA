Workflow Integration
Step 1: Generate your detection CSV
pythondf = export_detections_to_csv("model_review.csv")
Step 2: Run analysis to identify patterns
python# Run the confidence, size, spatial, and class error analyses
# This gives you data-driven insights to guide your manual review
Step 3: Manual review with structured annotations
Excel Annotation Categories
Column A: Detection ID (auto-filled from CSV)
Column B: Error Type (FP/FN/TP)
Column C: Root Cause Category

Localization Error (bbox wrong position/size)
Classification Error (wrong class assigned)
Background Confusion (non-object detected as object)
Scale Issue (object too small/large for model)
Occlusion (object partially hidden)
Image Quality (blur, noise, lighting)
Annotation Error (ground truth mistake)
Model Limitation (edge case model can't handle)

Column D: Specific Issue Description
Examples:

"Detected shadow as vehicle - dark rectangular shape"
"Missed small aircraft - only 15x20 pixels"
"Classified truck as tank - similar boxy shape"
"Bbox too small - only covers 60% of actual object"
"False alarm on building corner - geometric similarity to target"

Column E: Confidence Score Assessment

"High conf FP (0.85) - systematic background confusion"
"Low conf TP (0.35) - model uncertain but correct"
"Medium conf FN - should have been detected"

Column F: Context Factors

"Near image edge - partial view"
"Dense cluster area - 8 objects within 500px"
"Poor contrast region"
"Unusual pose/orientation"
"Multiple overlapping objects"

Column G: Suggested Fix

"Add more negative examples of this background type"
"Augment training with smaller object scales"
"Improve class separation between truck/tank"
"Better bbox regression training"
"Review annotation guidelines for this case"

Column H: Priority Level

High: Systematic errors affecting many detections
Medium: Moderate frequency issues
Low: Edge cases or rare occurrences

Column I: Training Data Implications

"Need more examples of this object type"
"Insufficient negative mining for this background"
"Class imbalance - too few tank examples"
"Missing data augmentation for this scenario"

Example Annotations
False Positive Examples:
ID: 42 | FP | Background Confusion | "Detected rectangular building as vehicle - similar shape/size to truck" | 0.78 conf | "Urban area with many geometric shapes" | "Add hard negative mining for rectangular buildings" | High | "Collect more urban background images"

ID: 67 | FP | Image Quality | "Noise artifacts detected as small aircraft" | 0.45 conf | "Low SNR region of image" | "Improve noise filtering or confidence thresholding" | Medium | "Add noisy negative examples to training"
False Negative Examples:
ID: 103 | FN | Scale Issue | "Missed small vehicle - only 12x18 pixels" | N/A | "Long range detection" | "Multi-scale training with smaller anchor sizes" | High | "Augment with more small object examples"

ID: 156 | FN | Occlusion | "Vehicle 70% hidden behind building" | N/A | "Urban environment with obstructions" | "Improve partial object detection capability" | Medium | "Add more partially occluded training examples"
Analysis-Driven Review Strategy
Use the automated analysis to guide where you spend review time:

Start with high-confidence FPs - these reveal systematic model blindspots
Review clustered errors - spatial/class patterns indicate training gaps
Examine size extremes - very large FNs or very small objects
Check edge cases - near image boundaries, extreme aspect ratios
Validate low-confidence TPs - potential annotation errors

Value-Added Observations
Most valuable annotations identify:

Systematic vs random errors
Trainable vs fundamental limitations
Data collection needs vs algorithm improvements
Annotation quality issues vs model performance
Environmental factors affecting detection
Class confusion patterns requiring better feature learning

Actionable insights format:
Each observation should answer: "What specific change to training data, model architecture, or processing pipeline would prevent this error?"
This structured approach transforms subjective review into quantified improvement roadmap for your detection model.
